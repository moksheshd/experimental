/**
 A car rental system is an application that manages the renting of automobiles for a short period of timeâ€”a few hours to a few weeks. 
 
 A car rental system has a number of offices in different locations within each city. 
 
 It allows the users to reserve and return a vehicle from different locations and is primarily located near airports or city areas.
 
 The car rental system keeps a list of all its clients in a database. The database includes the name, address, and contact number of each new customer.
 
 A member can reserve a car for a certain number of days, hire a car, or return the car that was rented. 
 
 A member makes a reservation by supplying the pickup and drop-off locations, the kind of vehicle, and the day and time of the reservation.
