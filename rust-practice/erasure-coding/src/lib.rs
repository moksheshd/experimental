//! # Erasure Coding Library
//!
//! This library implements erasure coding experiments and demonstrations.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! Erasure coding is a method of data protection in which data is broken into fragments,
//! expanded and encoded with redundant data pieces, and stored across different locations.
//!
//! ## Modules
//!
//! - Add your modules here as you build out the implementation

/// Simple hello function to verify the library structure
pub fn hello() {
    println!("Hello from the erasure_coding library!");
    println!("Ready to implement erasure coding algorithms.");
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_hello() {
        // This test just verifies the structure is working
        hello();
    }
}
