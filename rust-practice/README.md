# Rust Practice

This repository is for practicing Rust programming concepts and experimenting with the language.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your system

### Running the Code

To run the main program:
```bash
cargo run
```

To build without running:

```

To check for compilation errors:
```bash
cargo check
```

## Project Structure

- `src/main.rs` - Main entry point for the application
- `Cargo.toml` - Project configuration and dependencies
- `target/` - Build artifacts (auto-generated, ignored by git)

- Variables and mutability
- Data types
- Functions
- Control flow
- Ownership and borrowing
- Structs and enums
- Pattern matching
- Error handling
- Collections
